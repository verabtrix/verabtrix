NCT or also known as Neo Culture Technology, a K-pop group launched by SM Entertainment, debuted in 2016.

Currently, NCT has 23 members and four different units which are NCT U, NCT Dream, WayV and NCT 127.


This is Massively, a text-heavy, article-oriented design built around a huge background
image (with a new parallax implementation I'm testing) and scroll effects (powered by
Scrollex). A *slight* departure from all the one-pagers I've been doing lately, but one
that fulfills a few user requests and makes use of some new techniques I've been wanting
to try out. Enjoy it :)
